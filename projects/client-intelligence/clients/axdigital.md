# AXDIGITAL LLC

> **Status:** Active · **Owner:** Liudmyla · **Last updated:** 2026-08-11
>
> ⚠️ **SEED — created 2026-08-11 from Double's structured client properties only.** No Gmail,
> Ping, Drive or QuickBooks pass has been run on this client yet. It is in the weekend-sweep
> scope from now on, so the gaps below fill themselves; until then treat every `_(pending)_`
> as genuinely unknown rather than not applicable.

> **Sensitive data lives in the firm's systems, not here.** This file holds
> non-sensitive knowledge and links only. Logins, passwords, full account numbers,
> EINs, dollar figures, and personal contact details stay in Google Drive / Double
> / QuickBooks and are referenced by link. Never paste a secret or personal data
> into this file.

> **Two zones — what feeds the SOP vs what stays here.** This file is the master
> record. Its sections split into two zones:
> - **Operating (feeds the client SOP):** §1 Snapshot, §2 Contacts, §3 Systems &
>   access, §4 Obligations & recurring processes, §5 Key facts & quirks, §7 Links —
>   the standing info a covering bookkeeper needs to run this client.
> - **Working context (CI-only — never in the SOP):** §6 — the log and outstanding
>   tasks/meeting follow-ups. Live tasks live in Double / Ping (linked), not copied
>   here.
>
> The SOP is the curated view of the **Operating** zone. See the project README
> ("Client Intelligence ↔ the client SOP") for how the two stay in sync.

## 5. Key facts & quirks

Anything the team must know to serve this client well — special preferences,
watch-outs, one-off arrangements, history that affects the work.

> ⚠️ **Order these by consequence — only the first FOUR are published.** Both the Knowledge
> Hub and the client-intelligence review dashboard render **only the first four top-level
> bullets** of this section (and of §6's "Outstanding items"); a fifth never appears on
> either. So put first whatever would cause the worst mistake if someone didn't know it —
> **not** the oldest, and **not** whatever was added last. **Adding a bullet is a decision
> about where it goes**; appending to the end means the team never sees it. The cap lives in
> `clientCard()` — see the [render README's parsing contract](../../../.claude/skills/client-intelligence/render/README.md).

- **This file is a seed built from Double's properties alone** — nothing here came from email, a call, Drive or the books. The first weekend sweep on this client is what makes it useful.
- Named in [`best-broker-realty.md`](./best-broker-realty.md) §5 as one of the entities in the **same owner-group** (the serial-entity owner).
- **Assigned to Liudmyla Kazannik.** Her clients were absent from Client Intelligence entirely until 2026-08-11 — see §6. If something about this client seems missing, it probably is.

## 6. History & open questions
<!-- CI-only zone: this whole section stays in Client Intelligence and never goes into the SOP. -->

### Log
A running, dated record as we build this profile.

- 2026-08-11 — **File created (seed).** Built from Double's structured client properties during the coverage audit Lilian asked for. **The reason it did not exist before is structural, not accidental:** the weekend sweep's scope list was assembled from Lilian's and Maria's clients, so **every client assigned to Liudmyla was outside it** — seven QuickBooks-connected companies in total. All seven are now in scope. _(Worked by Lilian.)_

### Tax year YYYY — the review
<!-- Add one per tax year the firm reviews for this client. Records what gated the return,
     every question put to the client AND its answer once it arrives, what a prior-year
     return established, and what was decided. The client's ORGANIZER answers never go here
     (double-mcp §2.2); what the client tells US directly does. See the organizer-review skill. -->

- _(pending)_

### Outstanding items (CI-only — never in the SOP)
Open follow-ups from meetings / emails / calls — e.g. what Julia discussed last,
tasks owed. Keep the **live** list in Double tasks / Ping action items and point to
it here; these never go into the client SOP.

- **Everything about this client beyond Double's property columns is still unknown** — who the contacts are, what the business does, which bank feeds exist, its quirks. The next weekend sweep should treat this as a full historical pass, not an incremental one.

### Information still needed
The checklist of what's not captured yet — this is what the completeness audit
reports for this client.

- [ ] What the business actually does, its home state, and the owner's language
- [ ] Contacts and their roles (portal contacts are in Double)
- [ ] Bank/card feeds and where credentials live (Drive vault link)
- [ ] Fiscal year-end
- [ ] Whether the client belongs to a known owner-group already profiled here
- [ ] Whether Liudmyla keeps working notes for this client that should feed this file
